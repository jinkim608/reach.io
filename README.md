When holding a large device with only one hand, it is difficult for users to reach far corners of the screen to perform touch interactions.

We have developed an Android application to demonstrate our idea, Reach.io UI system.
The application is developed on Android Studio (with Gradle), made compatible with Android 4.0.3 and up.

#### 1.5. Reset of Indicators

#### 1.6. Animation
